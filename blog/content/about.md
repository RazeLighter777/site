I'm kind of a mad scientist, obsessed with building useful and unique programs. I enjoy the satisfaction of seeing my monsters come to life. I jump around frantically between domains/projects, learning as I go. 

Some of my interests include:
- Low-level systems programming
- Security research
- Distributed systems
- Kernel development
- Devops
- Infrastructure as code
- Maintaining a kubernetes cluster for my pretty GF so jellyfin and home assistant keep working. (Uptime 6 months so far)

Software I love:
- Linux kernel
- git
- NixOS
- ripgrep
- rsync
- talos linux
- QEMU/KVM
- landlock lsm
- k9s
- fluxcd

My languages of choice:
- Rust: It is powerful and has an easy to use package system. Say what you will about the borrow checker, but seems like programs I write in it don't have as many bugs. Generally my first choice for systems programming.
- C: Powerful like a chainsaw. Simple and elegant. A true weapon in the right hands, and a deadly CVE in the wrong ones. Will use over rust for simple programs that don't need a lot of dependencies or for kernel / embedded work.
- C++: Accursed, but sometimes necessary. Templates are black magic and I admire it in a horrified sort of way. I love Jason Turner's Modern C++ Design video series.

Languages I dislike:
- Python: Death to dynamic typing. pip is an abomination. It's 2025 why am I still having to install python2 
- javascript: I wish java applets succeeded over this. It's so cursed in so many ways. I avoid writing it if I can use typescript
